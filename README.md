# Vue.js Shopping Cart Test Project

Thanks for your interest in working at Company X! We're always excited to meet awesome people. We've created this test to help us understand your programming chops.

## What you'll build

We'd like you to build a Shopping Cart application using Vue.js, Vuex, and ES6. We've provided a JSON file with item data, but you're responsible for building the Cart. Your shopping cart should:

- display the list of items in the cart along with their relevant information;
- allow item quantities to be changed;
- display the subtotal for all the items in the cart.

## How you'll build it

- You can use any VCS platform you like — such as Gitlab or Github — as long as your project is publicly accessible.
- Build your shopping cart so we can test it in-browser.
- Write your application using Vue.js.
- Manage your data using a Vuex data store.
- Use the data provided in [items.json](items.json) to populate the cart. Don't make any changes to the data.
- It's OK to use a CSS framework (like Bootstrap). This isn't a CSS test. It doesn't have to be pretty.
- Don't use any other JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery.
- Once you're done, send us the link to your project so we can look it over.

## Requirements

- **Commit often.** We want to see your progress throughout the project.
- **Work quickly.** We will be looking at how far you get in the first hour as well as how long it takes you to arrive at a finished product. This project was designed to be completed quickly, so don't spend more than a few hours on it.
- **Write your own code.** While we understand that there are NPM pakages out there that take care of common problems, we ultimately want to see what _YOU_ can build, not what someone else has built.
- **Do your best work.** We're using this project as a viewport into who you are as a developer. Show us what you can do!

## Bonus points

- +10 points for making the data changes persistent. No... we're not going to give you any hints about how we want to see that done.
- +10 points if you include the functionality to remove items from the cart.
